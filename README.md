. Application Requirements/FEATURES:
• Create a functional photo-viewing mobile application.
The application will have multiple pages, navigation, and a search feature. The design will be
optimized for mobile device touchscreens allowing smooth interactions.
The application design will incorporate usability and accessibility to ensure users with disabilities
such as limited movement and colour blindness can interact with the application. Text will
contrast from the background and the application layout will be consistent to reduce the
learning curve. All buttons and elements should be large enough to be easily tapped.
• Integrate Unsplash API to retrieve the photo images.
The Unsplash API provides a large collection of free, high-quality photos that can be integrated
into a web or mobile application. It includes details about each photo such as the location and
photographer and the collection category that it has been classified.
• Allow the user to search for individual photos.
A search feature will be present on both the photos page and the collections page allowing users
to search for individual images and collections increasing accessibility and negating the need to
scroll through the entire library of images endlessly, although this will still be possible.
• Allow the user to search for collections of photos that are under categories such as “car”,
“Party” and “Beach”.
The search function will fetch data from the API relevant to the user's search input ensuring they
receive the expected results.
• Include a drawer navigation for improved user experience.
A drawer navigation will be present which is commonly featured on many mobile
applications allowing the user to access the menu when they please, without it being always
visible, blocking valuable screen space.
The navigation should appear consistent across all pages for a good user experience.
• Create two wireframes/sketches of the application.
Design documentation will be created to display the intended application page layouts.
• Perform testing on the major application features.
Testing will occur to ensure the app functions as intended to deliver the project requirements.
